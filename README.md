# 8-puzzle with basic A.I (A*)

In an 8-puzzle you’ve got a bunch of tiles in the wrong places and just one empty space that you can move around until the tiles are in the right order, this game was originally create by Sam Loyd in 1870.

To solve the 8-puzzle I used the A* algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2a_search_algorithm). It was my homework in the class of AI (EE-214-2007) when I was PHD student at aeronautical institute of technology.

The file “Trabalho de IA.doc” explain my work (in Portuguese).


Soon I will launch the english version (or not) !
